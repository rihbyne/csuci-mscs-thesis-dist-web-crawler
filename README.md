### Introduction

This repository contains the files required for a proper LaTeX
submission of an MSCS thesis CSU Channel Islands. Follow the
instructions in:
```
eu-ms-thesis-submission-procedure.pdf
```
for the technicalities of a submission to EU. See the Computer Science
Web site for general information about MSCS:

https://compsci.csuci.edu/degrees/mscs/index.htm

The files `thesis-template.*` contain the templates for writing the
thesis in LaTeX in the required format (double spaced, proper margins,
cover pages, etc.). Note that only the files `thesis-template.tex` and
`references.bib` are modified by the writer; all the other files
(e.g., `thesis-template.aux`) are generated by LaTeX, and are not to be
modified by hand.

### Required files for Thesis Submission to the Broome Library

- Page 1: Cover Page
- Page 2: Copyright Page
- Page 3: Signature Page
- Page 4: Distribution License Page
- Page 5+: Thesis Pages

### Using Thesis Template

- Setup Name, Thesis title and Advisor in project-info.tex
- Make sure to replace Names and Dates with real values
- References should be put in `references.bib` file in bibtex format
- Building is done with pdflatex and bibtex with the following commands
```
pdflatex <thesis>.tex && bibtex <thesis> && pdflatex <thesis>.tex && pdflatex <thesis>.tex
```

### Example Thesis Defense Announcement

The file
```
defense-announcement.tex
```
contains example thesis defense announcements. If someone wants to
compose a template LaTeX source, let's pull it into this repository
for others to use.


### Further resources

I am maintaining a page on doing graduate research, with helpful
articles and a slides from a presentation given for MSCS students at
the beginning of each academic year. Ask me for the password if you
