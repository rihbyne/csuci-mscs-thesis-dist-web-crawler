In Summary, when it comes to detecting similarity between two web pages, the pages are converted into
bag of phrases. The challenge lies in storage requirements because the word size for a phrase $p$ adds
a space complexity of O$(np)$, where $n$ is no. of times we have to save the document. Applying a hash
function outputs a integer and is able to improve space complexity of bag of phrases to O$(n)$.
Minhash\cite{dedupe} brings storage requirement to O$(1)$ but time complexity of query documents is
O$(n)$. Simhashing\cite{dedupe} performs better than Minhash by querying on a fix $q$ sorted list of
hashes. Its time complexity is given as O$(q * log(n))$. Efficient Querying and Insertion of simhashes
calls for project implementation of its own.
