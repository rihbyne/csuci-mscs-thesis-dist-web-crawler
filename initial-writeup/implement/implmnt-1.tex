\noindent
Whirlpool is a continuous, topical crawler(section \ref{covfresh}) that never terminates by itself, figure \ref{fig:missionchar}. The focus is to maximize freshness over coverage of content crawled from given seeds. The seeds are active job portals which serve as a perfect candidates to continuously monitor and revisit already visited pages. This is done without overhauling the seed servers by implementating the url frontier scheme (section \ref{scheme}).
