\chapter{Conclusion \& Future Work}
This chapter is a list of follow-up ideas that can be turned into potential projects. These are complex and
important topics that deserve a report of their own. This thesis wont wouldn't do them justice by making
them superficial side notes.

  \item[crawler data \& log events search using Elasticsearch Engine] \hfill \\
    Traditionally elasticsearch is being used to power sophisticated search functionality on web
    applications. This can be a fun and educational project using elasticsearch to search for log
    events in crawler subsystems as well as get analytics on collected data in MongoDB. The educational
    part here is learning to model, index, search, and analyze data efficiently.
  \item[Adding comprehensive coverage] \hfill \\
    Currently this project only performs crawling within the bounds of finite seed set. Being able to
    discovering new relevant websites similar to input seeds can make it comprehensive.
  \item[Content Extraction] \hfill \\
    While this thesis focuses on extracting structured HTML that appears multiple times on similar pages,
    a more sophisticated way to extract is through machine learning that can extract unstructured html
    \cite{contentExtract} appearing only once.
  \item[Categorizing Jobs using Supervised/RNN classifier] \hfill \\
    Producing higher dimensional data through feature extraction on collected data to build job
    classifier.
  \item[SeenTest: Inserting and Querying Simhashes] \hfill \\
    To work on a performant solution to build the data store to query simhashes efficiently and achieve
    running time complexity of O$(q * log(n))$ mentioned in section \ref{handle_dedupe}. To implement
    this, various backends can be taken into consideration such as Cassendra, MongoDB, or Riak.
