important topics that deserve a report of their own. This thesis wont wouldn't do them justice by making
them superficial side notes.

    To work on a performant solution to build the data store to query simhashes efficiently and achieve
    running time complexity of O$(q * log(n))$ mentioned in section \ref{handle_dedupe}. To implement
    this, various backends can be taken into consideration such as Cassendra, MongoDB, or Riak.
